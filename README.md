# Changing-Technology-Game
This was a part of my previous assignment when I took Artificial Intelligence course.

This program is an AI that uses MDP algorithm to solve the problem of the game. It is a race game where the agent position after randomly simulated depends on the given probability, and by using value iteration, the AI will maximize the probability to win.

To run the program, open command prompt and type:
python main.py <input_file> <output_file>
Replace the parameter input_file and output_file with the desired files.

For more explanation, please see the problem specification on the .pdf file.
